## Introduction
Amazon is one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, and its sales data holds valuable insights into consumer trends and product performance. This analysis report aims to provide a deeper understanding of Amazon's sales data.

## Dataset details
The dataset includes information on order IDs, SKUs, designs, colors, quantities, amounts, and fulfillment details. It spans across different tables, providing a comprehensive view of Amazon's sales ecosystem.
## Insights
Here are the list of questions, which are answered by me using My SQL:

    ♦ Counting Of the number of Columns.
    ♦ Case statement.
    ♦ Compute total sales amounts for each category by joining the amazon_sales and sale_report tables, matching on sizes. Display the category and the total sales.
    ♦ Retrieve ship_city and ship_state from amazon_sales for records with sizes not 'L' and not present in sale_report's distinct sizes with 'L'.
    ♦ Top 20 categories in 'may_2022' for 'Moments' catalog based on the sum of 'Final_MRP_Old.
            ♦ Method1 (Without join function)
            ♦ Method 2 (By join function)
    ♦ Identify the category with an amount exceeding the average amount across all categories.
            ♦ Method1 (without with function)
            ♦ Method2 (with function)
    ♦ Retrieve the top 100 'Fulfilment-Category' combinations from 'amazon_sales,' aggregating 'international_sale_report' sales by 'Style,' and order by total amount in descending order.
    ♦ Summarize the total quantities in the 'amazon_sales' table by 'Courier_Status,' ordering the results by total quantity in descending order.
    ♦ Retrieve Style, Category, Qty, Amount, and RankedQty from the joined 'amazon_sales' and 'international_sale_report' tables. Include records where Amount is <= 1000, and ranking is based on Amount within each Qty and Style combination.
    ♦ How does the recursive CTE "Category" help summarize the total order quantity for each Courier_Status in the 'amazon_sales' and 'sale_report' tables?
    ♦ Get SKU, Design_No, and Color for 'L' size items with the highest stock in the 'sale_report' table
    ♦ Get Order_ID and Status1 from the 'amazon_sales' table for orders with the highest amount in the city of 'JALANDHAR'.
    ♦ It identify the Status1 with the maximum count of occurrences in the amazon_sales table.
    ♦ Describe how the recursive CTE "units" contributes to finding the maximum total amount for each ship_city in 'amazon_sales' and 'may_2022' tables.

## Future Steps
This project lays the foundation for more in-depth analyses, including trend forecasting, customer behavior analysis, and optimization of fulfillment strategies.
